# Tax
# Executive Summary
```
My findings across the six geo-political regions (North East, North West, North Central, South East, South West and South South) concerning the attitude of Nigerians towards tax are as follows:
-	A greater proportion of Nigerians are saying that they donâ€™t pay tax.
-	Over 50% are not satisfied with the way state administration has spent their tax money
-	Wholeheartedly, Nigerians are willing to pay additional tax for better services such as Health clinics, Policing and water supply.
These findings are based on a household survey in the 36 states of Nigeria by the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG) conducted in 2018.
Background story
In developed countries, tax is a significant contributor to their economic growth as their well-designed tax policies encourage business investments, innovation and entrepreneurship. More importantly, Taxes are used effectively to invest in public services, infrastructure, education, healthcare and social welfare. I want to see Nigeria follow in this footstep. According to the household survey conducted by NESG, I did an analysis to assess the attitude of Nigerians towards tax payment.
Conclusion
 At first glance, there seems to be a contradiction in the attitude of Nigerians towards the payment of tax. Presently, they are not paying much tax. However, according to the NESG survey they are willing to pay additional taxes provided they will get better services especially in healthcare, education, electricity and water supply. I think it is a case of trust deficit between the government and the governed.
